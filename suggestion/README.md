# Suggestion System
A feature-rich suggestion system, condensed into a single custom command.<br>
This is similar to the current system used in the YAGPDB Support Server.

## Features
* Logging channels
* Management commands
* Cooldown to prevent spam

## Installing 
In case you need a refresher, or don't know how to add a custom command, please read [this](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz/the-custom-command-interface) tutorial.

For now, we will just add the system to your server and elaborate later on the various configuration variables as well as commands and subcommands.

Copy the entire script from [suggestion.go.tmpl](suggestion.go.tmpl) and add it as a new custom command. Set the trigger type to RegEx and paste the following as the trigger:

###### Suggestion System Trigger
```
(?i)\A(\-\s?|<@!?204255221017214977>\s*)((del(ete)?|edit)?suggest(ion)?|(sa|suggestadmin)\s+((?:mark)?dupe|deny|implement(ed)?|archive|approved?|comment))(\s+|\z)
```

| ‚ö† Make sure to replace the `-` at the beginning of the trigger with your server's prefix.
| ---- |

You will not be able to save yet, as the custom command code is slightly over the limit as is. To fix this, we have to do one minor tweak: remove the large leading comment as well as the second comment:

###### What to remove
```diff
- {{/*
- 	This command is the main suggestion command with suggestion create/edit/delete 
-   and suggestadmin commands. Usage: Refer README.md
-
-	Recommended trigger: Regex trigger with non case sensitive and trigger 
-  `\A(\-\s?|<@!?204255221017214977>\s*)((del(ete)?|edit)?suggest(ion)?|(sa|suggestadmin)\s+((?:mark)?dupe|deny|implement(ed)?|archive|approved?|comment))(\s+|\z)`
-   Note: If your prefix is not `-` replace the `-` at the start of the trigger with your prefix.
-	P.S. - REMOVE This comment so that you can save the command. Otherwise youll get an error!
- */}}
- 
- {{/* CONFIGURATION AREA STARTS */}}
{{$Suggestion_Channel:=737324313341853796}}
```
Remove the text you see here as red from your custom command. Now you can save, which you should definitely do.

## Configuration
Okay, there are still a few things to do before your suggestion system is set up, which are the configuration variables. Please take your time to read through their description before making any changes.

### Channels 
| ‚Ñπ Among these variables, all channels can be separate or the same. |
| ---- |

* `$Suggestion_Channel`<br>
   This is the main channel, where all suggestions made through the command will show up - This is the `#suggestions` channel on the support server.
* `$Logging_Channel`<br>
   This is the channel where the authors are notified if a suggestion was denied, approved, implemented, or marked as dupe. In the YAGPDB server, this is the `#suggestion-discussion` channel.
* `$Implemented_Channel`<br>
   The channel where suggestions which have been marked as implemented are sent. This provides a good way to organise all implemented suggestions into a separate channel. On the support server, you can find this channel as `#implemented-suggestions`.
* `$Approved_Channel`
   Where approved suggestions are being sent to. This is not the same as implemented suggestions: you can see approved suggestions as "being worked on", and implemented suggestions as "this is now a feature". In the Support Server, we log those under `#implemented-suggestions` as well.

| üõë Do not leave any channel ID blank, as this will break the system. |
| ---- |

### Other
* `$Mod_Roles`<br>
   List of all role IDs which should have access to the management commands explained further down. There is no need to specify the roles which have `Administrator` permission, they will gain automatic access. Separate the individual role IDs by spaces.
*  `$Cooldown`<br>
   The cooldown in seconds between consecutive suggestions to prevent spam. Set this to `0` to disable, Mods and Admins will automatically bypass this.
* `$Upvote`<br>
   The emoji to use for upvoting a suggestion. Both inbuilt and custom emojis are supported. For custom emoji, use the `name:id` / `a:name:id` format. Otherwise, the corresponding unicode character. See below for an example.
* `$Downvote`<br>
   Same as above, however for downvoting a suggestion.

###### Upvote and Downvote example with unicode (inbuilt) emoji
```go
{{$Upvote:="üëç"}}
{{$Downvote:="üëé"}}
```

###### Upvote and Downvote example with custom emoji
```go
{{$Upvote := "upvote:524907425531428864"}}
{{$Downvote := "downvote:524907425032175638"}}
```

Configure the variables to your liking and save again.

## FAQ
**Q: What is a suggestion ID?**<br>
A: This is just the message ID of the suggestion message. If you are unsure how to get message IDs, you can read [this](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) handy Discord article.

**Q: I can't implement an approved suggestion! Why?**<br>
A: This is very likely because you copied the wrong message ID. Double check your input.

**Q: When I try to save, it errors with "response too long". What am I doing wrong?**<br>
A: You need to remove the first two comments, as shown [further up](#What-to-remove).
