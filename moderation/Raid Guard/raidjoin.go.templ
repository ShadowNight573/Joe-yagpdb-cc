{{/*
	Trigger: member join
	This code is to be placed in the "Join Message" section.

	About: This part of the code will track all incomming new members to a server. If their account is younger than 1 day then they will get added to the raid
	list. This list will expire every 10 minutes to account for any members not part of a RAID.
